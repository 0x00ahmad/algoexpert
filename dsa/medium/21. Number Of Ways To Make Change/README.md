# 21. Number Of Ways To Make Change

It's a bit tricky as it uses dynamic programming, but to sum it up in one line:

You have to build an array of length n which will be updated with each denom's capacity
to add to the ways of generating a change

## Time Complexity

O(nd)

## Space Complexity

O(n)
