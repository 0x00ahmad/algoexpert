# 11. Valudate BST

To properly check if the tree is valid, we have to keep a track of a certain minimum and
maximum value for each node that they should not exceed, which are the min/maxes from their
parent nodes

### Time Complexity

O(n) ~ n = nodes

### Space Complexity

O(d) ~ d = depth of tree
